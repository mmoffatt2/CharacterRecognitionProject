# _Character Recognition Project_

Following the paper Neural Networks for Pen Characters Recognition, this project focused on creating a Neural Network that can detect characters associated with inputted pen strokes. I applied the neural network to the 11640 characters of the data set ujipenchars2.txt. Below is a link to the code:
